PayPal documentation problems:
* Application "Return URL" list is hidden and needs to be made much more prominent. I wasted hours on the problem before seeing that setting.
The description does not relay the importance of the feature and the consequences of not setting it correctly.
* No description I could find of the payload that's returned by PayPal login.
* How to request scope on login and again on getting customerinfo isn't specified and examples are few.
* When save fails on the SANDBOX APP SETTINGS page, the error message is in the middle and there's no other indicator something went wrong.
* Docs switch between "Client ID" and other names like "App ID" causing confusion
* developer.paypal.com extremely short session timeout is very annoying, particularly on docs only pages that shouldn't require auth anyways.
